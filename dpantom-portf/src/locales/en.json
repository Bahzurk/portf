    "project1DescriptionFull": "A wellness app designed to help college students develop healthier habits through personalized meal and workout plans, social sharing, and motivational progress tracking. Based on user interviews, I identified key challenges like poor time management, lack of cooking knowledge, and low fitness motivation. My research-driven design focuses on simplicity, positive reinforcement, and visual feedback to encourage daily engagement. Inspired by apps like BeReal and Strava, it turns health into a social, structured, and rewarding experience.",
    "project2Title": "Enjoy Oxford",
    "project2DescriptionFull": "This project aimed to enhance the social media presence of Enjoy Oxford, a non-profit promoting community engagement in Oxford, Ohio. Through an analysis of 30 social media posts across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Pinterest, I identified trends in content performance, audience engagement, and platform strengths. My research showed that Instagram, especially Reels, outperformed Facebook in reaching key audiences such as college students, families, and residents. I recommended reallocating resources to short-form video content on TikTok and Instagram to capitalize on viral potential and high engagement. Additionally, I suggested deactivating inactive platforms like Twitter for a more focused presence. To foster local business growth and community building, I proposed creating content around “uptown” events and establishments, showcasing Oxford’s culture and boosting local pride. The strategy is built around a messaging framework that promotes curiosity, belonging, and participation, making social media a key tool for community connection.",
